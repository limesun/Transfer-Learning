Transfer Learning Test : ULMFiT & BERT on Newsgroup data

Plus, ULMFiT (fastai/course_v3 - Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3) Lesson 4 test on Movielens 100k data dataset

* Take-away

Actually, the original paper of ULMFiT runed the algorithm on the 4 classes instead of the whole 20 classes on AG Newsgroup data so it was able to earn the accurracy about 95%. As this kind of deep learning methods (including transfer learning) mandatorily requires the large size of training set (at least, several K per class). Maybe, the AG Newsgroup data as itself is not fit for any test of deep learning algorithms.
